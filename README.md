# Open Android Radio Station Lists
In this document are a variety of JSON files, these correspond to station presets I have created which are used as the default import options in [Open Android Radio](https://github.com/TypicalNerds/Open-Android-Radio).

# Are these stations Geo-Restricted?
Most of these stations will be using URLs tailored for UK Audiences, this means that they may not be supported or may be geo-restricted for users outside of the UK.
These URLs may break or change without warning so don't rely on them as your primary reliance.

# Where do you source these links?
Many of them are grabbed via online radio streaming sites such as [Radiofeeds](http://www.radiofeeds.co.uk/).
If any radio operators want their stations removed, please contact me or submit a takedown notice with the name of your company and all associated stations that I can confirm are related to your company will be removed, provided that the notice comes from an organisational email address (not just a generic personal gmail account).
